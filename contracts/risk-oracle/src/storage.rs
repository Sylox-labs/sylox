//! Storage keys and the per asset ring buffer. technical-doc.md Section 5.8,
//! 15.1.
//!
//! The ring is stored as one packed `Bytes` blob, not a `Vec<RingSlot>`.
//! A `Vec` of `#[contracttype]` structs encodes each `RingSlot` as an XDR
//! map of named fields, which measured about 440 bytes per slot (105,732
//! bytes for 240 slots), 61% over the current `contract_data_entry_size_bytes`
//! limit of 65,536 (see the PR's Phase 1 report). Packing each slot into
//! fixed width fields with no field names gets one slot down to
//! `SLOT_BYTES` (112, padded from 106 used bytes), 26,880 bytes of slot
//! data for 240 slots (plus the header below), comfortably under the
//! limit. This is the "Storing each slot as a contracttype map with field
//! names would be several times larger" note in Section 5.8, made
//! concrete.
//!
//! `epoch % RING_SLOTS` gives a slot's POSITION, never its identity. A
//! position can hold a slot from any epoch congruent to it mod
//! `RING_SLOTS`, or nothing at all (never written, or overturned and not
//! yet reposted). Every read that wants epoch `e`'s slot must check that
//! the slot stored at `e % RING_SLOTS` actually has `epoch == e`; if it
//! does not (wrong epoch or state `Empty`), epoch `e` is MISSING, counted
//! by `max_missing_epochs` (ADR-005), never read as if it were present.
//! `get_slot` and `get_window` below are the only ways Phase 2 code should
//! read a slot; neither returns a slot whose stored epoch does not match
//! the one asked for.
