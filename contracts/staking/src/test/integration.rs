//! Required integration test (task brief): deploy the REAL

//! stake and probe, keeper posts signals, the endpoint comes from the
//! real `aggregate`, a signal dispute is opened, timed out via
//! `resolve_signal_dispute_timeout`, and bonds are released. Proves
//! the Section 12.3 interface matches both sides of the real call,
//! not a mock's approximation of it.
//!
//! Real SAC USDC throughout (`register_stellar_asset_contract_v2`,
